The lateral raise is the go-to exercise for building the medial (side) head of the deltoid, creating the appearance of wider shoulders and a more V-shaped torso.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides with palms facing your body.

2. **Start Position**: Maintain a slight bend in your elbows and keep your core engaged. Lean very slightly forward.

3. **Raise**: Lift the dumbbells out to your sides until your arms are parallel to the floor, leading with your elbows.

4. **Top Position**: At the top, your arms should form a T with your body. Keep a slight bend in your elbows throughout.

5. **Lower**: Slowly lower the weights back to your sides with control.

## Tips

- Use lighter weights and focus on form
- Lead with your elbows, not your hands
- Don't swing or use momentum
- Think about pouring water from a pitcher at the top

## Variations

- **Seated Lateral Raise**: Eliminates momentum
- **Cable Lateral Raise**: Constant tension throughout
- **Leaning Lateral Raise**: Hold a pole for increased range
- **Single-Arm Lateral Raise**: Focus on one side at a time

## Common Mistakes

- Using too much weight
- Swinging the weights up with momentum
- Raising the arms too high (above parallel)
- Shrugging the shoulders during the lift
