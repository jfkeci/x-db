The Romanian deadlift (RDL) is one of the best exercises for developing the posterior chain. Unlike conventional deadlifts, the RDL emphasizes the eccentric (lowering) phase and keeps more tension on the hamstrings.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding a barbell with an overhand grip at thigh level. Shoulders back, chest up.

2. **Hinge**: Push your hips back while maintaining a slight bend in your knees. Keep the bar close to your legs as you lower it.

3. **Descend**: Lower the bar until you feel a strong stretch in your hamstrings, typically around mid-shin level. Keep your back flat throughout.

4. **Drive**: Squeeze your glutes and drive your hips forward to return to standing, pulling the bar up your thighs.

5. **Repeat**: Maintain tension in your hamstrings and repeat for desired reps.

## Tips

- Keep the bar close to your body throughout
- Think "hips back" rather than "bend forward"
- Don't round your lower back
- Feel the stretch in your hamstrings at the bottom

## Variations

- **Dumbbell RDL**: Easier to learn, good for beginners
- **Single-Leg RDL**: Unilateral version for balance and stability
- **Deficit RDL**: Stand on platform for greater range of motion
- **Snatch-Grip RDL**: Wider grip for upper back emphasis

## Common Mistakes

- Rounding the lower back
- Bending knees too much (turning it into a squat)
- Not hinging at the hips enough
- Letting the bar drift away from the body
- Going too heavy before mastering form
