Mountain climbers are a full-body exercise that combines cardio with core strengthening, making them perfect for HIIT workouts and conditioning.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Start in a high plank position with hands directly under shoulders, body in a straight line.

2. **Drive**: Quickly drive one knee toward your chest while keeping the other leg extended.

3. **Switch**: Rapidly switch legs, driving the opposite knee forward as the first leg extends back.

4. **Rhythm**: Continue alternating legs in a running motion while maintaining the plank position.

5. **Breathe**: Keep breathing rhythmically throughout the movement.

## Tips

- Keep your hips down—don't let them pike up
- Drive your knees as close to your chest as possible
- Maintain a steady, sustainable pace
- Keep your core engaged throughout

## Variations

- **Slow Mountain Climbers**: Controlled pace for beginners
- **Cross-Body Mountain Climbers**: Drive knee toward opposite elbow for obliques
- **Sliding Mountain Climbers**: Use sliders for reduced impact
- **Spiderman Mountain Climbers**: Drive knee to outside of elbow

## Common Mistakes

- Letting hips rise too high
- Not bringing knees far enough forward
- Bouncing or losing plank form
- Holding breath instead of breathing rhythmically
