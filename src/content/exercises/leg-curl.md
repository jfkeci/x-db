The leg curl is an isolation exercise that directly targets the hamstrings. It's essential for balanced leg development and can help prevent knee injuries by strengthening the muscles that support the joint.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Lie face down on the leg curl machine. Adjust the pad so it rests just above your ankles on your Achilles tendon area.

2. **Position**: Grip the handles and keep your hips pressed firmly against the bench. Your legs should be fully extended.

3. **Curl**: Contract your hamstrings to curl the weight up, bringing your heels toward your glutes.

4. **Squeeze**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your hamstrings for a brief pause.

5. **Lower**: Slowly lower the weight back to the starting position without letting it slam down.

## Tips

- Keep your hips pressed down throughout
- Don't use momentum or jerk the weight
- Focus on the mind-muscle connection with your hamstrings
- Control the negative portion of the lift

## Variations

- **Seated Leg Curl**: Sitting position, different angle of resistance
- **Single-Leg Curl**: Unilateral version for imbalance correction
- **Standing Leg Curl**: One leg at a time while standing
- **Swiss Ball Leg Curl**: Bodyweight version using stability ball

## Common Mistakes

- Lifting hips off the bench
- Using momentum to swing the weight
- Not achieving full range of motion
- Going too heavy and sacrificing form
