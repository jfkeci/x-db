Named after Arnold Schwarzenegger, this shoulder press variation incorporates rotation throughout the movement, engaging all three heads of the deltoid for complete shoulder development.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Sit on a bench with back support, holding a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height with palms facing you (like the top of a curl).

2. **Start Position**: Keep your elbows in front of your body with the dumbbells at collarbone level.

3. **Press and Rotate**: Press the dumbbells overhead while simultaneously rotating your palms to face forward. Your arms should end up fully extended with palms facing away.

4. **Top Position**: At the top, the dumbbells should be directly overhead with arms straight but not locked.

5. **Reverse**: Lower the weights while rotating your palms back toward you, returning to the starting position.

## Tips

- Keep the movement smooth and controlled
- Don't rush the rotation—let it happen naturally
- Maintain a slight arch in your lower back
- Don't lock out your elbows at the top

## Variations

- **Standing Arnold Press**: More core engagement required
- **Single-Arm Arnold Press**: Unilateral version
- **Seated Arnold Press with Twist**: Extra rotation at the bottom
- **Alternating Arnold Press**: One arm at a time

## Common Mistakes

- Rotating too quickly or abruptly
- Arching the back excessively
- Using weights that are too heavy
- Not completing the full rotation
