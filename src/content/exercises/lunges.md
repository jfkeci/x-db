Lunges are an excellent functional exercise that works each leg independently, helping to correct muscle imbalances and improve athletic performance.

## How to Perform

1. **Start**: Stand tall with feet hip-width apart, hands on hips or at your sides.

2. **Step**: Take a large step forward with one leg.

3. **Lower**: Bend both knees to lower your body until your back knee nearly touches the floor.

4. **Push**: Drive through your front heel to return to the starting position.

5. **Alternate**: Repeat with the other leg.

## Tips

- Keep your torso upright throughout the movement
- Don't let your front knee extend past your toes
- Take a big enough step to allow proper depth
- Keep your core engaged for balance

## Variations

- **Reverse Lunges**: Step backward instead of forward (easier on knees)
- **Walking Lunges**: Continue moving forward with each rep
- **Bulgarian Split Squat**: Rear foot elevated on bench
- **Weighted Lunges**: Hold dumbbells or a barbell for added resistance
