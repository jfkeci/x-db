Jumping jacks are a timeless cardio exercise that require no equipment and effectively raise your heart rate while engaging muscles throughout your entire body.

## How to Perform

1. **Start Position**: Stand upright with your feet together and arms at your sides.

2. **Jump Out**: Jump your feet out to the sides (wider than hip-width) while simultaneously raising your arms overhead.

3. **Jump In**: Immediately jump your feet back together while lowering your arms to your sides.

4. **Rhythm**: Continue in a rhythmic, controlled manner, landing softly on the balls of your feet.

5. **Breathe**: Maintain steady breathing throughout the exercise.

## Tips

- Land softly to reduce impact on joints
- Keep your core engaged throughout
- Maintain a consistent rhythm
- Start slow and increase speed as you warm up

## Variations

- **Half Jacks**: Arms only go to shoulder height
- **Squat Jacks**: Add a squat when feet land wide
- **Cross Jacks**: Cross feet and arms alternately
- **Star Jumps**: Explode into a star shape at the top
- **Low-Impact Jacks**: Step side to side instead of jumping

## Common Mistakes

- Landing with locked knees
- Not fully extending arms overhead
- Moving too fast and losing form
- Holding breath during exercise
