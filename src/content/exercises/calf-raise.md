The calf raise is a simple yet effective exercise for building the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles of the lower leg. Strong calves improve athletic performance and ankle stability.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Stand on a raised surface (step, block, or calf raise machine) with the balls of your feet on the edge and heels hanging off.

2. **Start Position**: Hold onto something for balance if needed. Let your heels drop below the platform to feel a stretch in your calves.

3. **Raise**: Push through the balls of your feet to raise your heels as high as possible, coming up onto your toes.

4. **Squeeze**: At the top, squeeze your calf muscles and hold briefly.

5. **Lower**: Slowly lower your heels back below the platform level with control.

## Tips

- Use a full range of motion for maximum benefit
- Pause at the top and bottom of each rep
- Keep your knees straight but not locked
- Progress by adding weight with dumbbells or a barbell

## Variations

- **Seated Calf Raise**: Targets the soleus more
- **Single-Leg Calf Raise**: Unilateral version for imbalances
- **Donkey Calf Raise**: Bent over position for greater stretch
- **Smith Machine Calf Raise**: For added resistance

## Common Mistakes

- Bouncing at the bottom of the movement
- Not achieving full range of motion
- Bending the knees during the movement
- Going too fast and using momentum
