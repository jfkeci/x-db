Crunches are a foundational core exercise that effectively targets the upper abdominals when performed with proper form and control.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Place your hands behind your head or across your chest.

2. **Brace**: Engage your core by drawing your belly button toward your spine.

3. **Curl**: Lift your shoulder blades off the ground by contracting your abs. Focus on curling your ribcage toward your pelvis.

4. **Squeeze**: Hold the top position briefly, feeling the contraction in your abs.

5. **Lower**: Slowly lower back down with control, keeping tension in your abs.

## Tips

- Don't pull on your neck with your hands
- Focus on the contraction, not the range of motion
- Keep your lower back pressed into the floor
- Exhale as you crunch up

## Variations

- **Reverse Crunches**: Lift hips instead of shoulders for lower abs
- **Bicycle Crunches**: Add rotation for oblique engagement
- **Weighted Crunches**: Hold a plate on your chest for resistance
- **Cable Crunches**: Kneeling crunch with cable for progressive overload

## Common Mistakes

- Pulling on the neck with hands
- Using momentum to swing up
- Coming up too high (it's a crunch, not a sit-up)
- Not controlling the lowering phase
