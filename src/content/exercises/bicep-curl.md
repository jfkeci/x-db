The bicep curl is the classic arm-building exercise, isolating the biceps for maximum muscle growth and strength development.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding dumbbells at your sides with palms facing forward.

2. **Curl**: Keeping your upper arms stationary, bend your elbows to curl the weights toward your shoulders.

3. **Squeeze**: At the top, squeeze your biceps for a moment.

4. **Lower**: Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position with control.

5. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions.

## Tips

- Keep your elbows pinned to your sides
- Don't swing the weights or use momentum
- Control the eccentric (lowering) phase
- Fully extend your arms at the bottom

## Variations

- **Hammer Curls**: Palms face each other (targets brachialis)
- **Incline Curls**: Performed on incline bench for greater stretch
- **Concentration Curls**: Seated, elbow braced against thigh
- **Barbell Curls**: Both arms work together with heavier load
- **Preacher Curls**: Eliminates momentum, strict isolation

## Common Mistakes

- Swinging the body to lift the weight
- Moving the elbows forward during the curl
- Not using full range of motion
- Going too heavy and sacrificing form
