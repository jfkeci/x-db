The skull crusher, also known as the lying tricep extension, is one of the most effective exercises for building tricep mass. It targets all three heads of the triceps muscle.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Lie on a flat bench holding an EZ bar (or straight bar) with a narrow overhand grip, arms extended straight up over your chest.

2. **Position**: Keep your upper arms stationary and perpendicular to the floor throughout the movement.

3. **Lower**: Bend at the elbows to lower the bar toward your forehead (or just behind your head), keeping your upper arms still.

4. **Bottom Position**: Lower until your forearms are just past parallel to the floor, feeling a stretch in your triceps.

5. **Extend**: Push the bar back up by extending your elbows, squeezing your triceps at the top.

## Tips

- Keep your elbows tucked in, not flared out
- Control the weight—don't let it drop
- Lower to just above or behind your forehead
- Keep your upper arms stationary

## Variations

- **Dumbbell Skull Crusher**: More range of motion
- **Incline Skull Crusher**: Different angle of resistance
- **Cable Skull Crusher**: Constant tension
- **Single-Arm Skull Crusher**: Unilateral version

## Common Mistakes

- Flaring elbows out too wide
- Moving the upper arms during the lift
- Using too much weight
- Lowering the bar to the nose instead of forehead/behind head
