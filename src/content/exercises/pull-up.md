The pull-up is one of the best bodyweight exercises for developing upper body pulling strength and building a wide, muscular back.

## How to Perform

1. **Grip**: Hang from a pull-up bar with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width, palms facing away.

2. **Engage**: Depress your shoulders and engage your lats.

3. **Pull**: Drive your elbows down and back, pulling your chest toward the bar.

4. **Top**: Continue until your chin is over the bar.

5. **Lower**: Slowly lower yourself back to a full hang with control.

## Tips

- Avoid swinging or using momentum
- Keep your core tight throughout
- Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top
- Control the descent—don't just drop down

## Progressions

- **Assisted Pull-Ups**: Use a band or machine
- **Negative Pull-Ups**: Focus on the lowering phase
- **Chin-Ups**: Palms facing you (easier)
- **Weighted Pull-Ups**: Add weight for advanced training
