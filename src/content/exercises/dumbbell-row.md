The dumbbell row is an essential back-building exercise that allows you to work each side independently, helping to identify and correct strength imbalances.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Place one knee and hand on a bench for support. Hold a dumbbell in the opposite hand with arm fully extended.

2. **Position**: Keep your back flat and parallel to the ground. Your supporting arm should be directly under your shoulder.

3. **Pull**: Drive your elbow up and back, pulling the dumbbell toward your hip. Squeeze your shoulder blade at the top.

4. **Lower**: Slowly lower the weight back to full arm extension with control.

5. **Repeat**: Complete all reps on one side, then switch.

## Tips

- Keep your core tight to prevent rotation
- Don't let your shoulder drop at the bottom
- Pull to your hip, not your chest
- Control the weight—don't use momentum

## Variations

- **Chest-Supported Row**: Lie face down on incline bench for stricter form
- **Meadows Row**: Barbell in landmine, unique angle for lat development
- **Kroc Row**: Higher rep, controlled cheating for strength
- **Pendlay Row**: Barbell from floor with strict form

## Common Mistakes

- Rotating the torso during the pull
- Using momentum to swing the weight
- Not achieving full range of motion
- Shrugging the shoulder instead of rowing
