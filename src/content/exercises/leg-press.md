The leg press is an effective lower body exercise that allows you to load the legs heavily while minimizing stress on the lower back, making it ideal for building quad and glute strength.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Sit in the leg press machine with your back and head flat against the pad. Place your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform.

2. **Unrack**: Press the platform up and release the safety handles. Your legs should be extended but not locked out.

3. **Lower**: Slowly bend your knees to lower the platform toward your chest. Go as deep as you can while keeping your lower back pressed against the pad.

4. **Press**: Drive through your heels to push the platform back up, stopping just short of locking your knees.

5. **Repeat**: Maintain control throughout and repeat for desired reps. Re-engage safeties when finished.

## Tips

- Keep your lower back pressed firmly against the pad
- Don't let your knees cave inward
- Avoid locking out your knees at the top
- Control the descent—don't let gravity do the work

## Variations

- **High Foot Placement**: Emphasizes glutes and hamstrings
- **Low Foot Placement**: Emphasizes quadriceps
- **Narrow Stance**: Targets outer quads
- **Wide Stance**: Targets inner thighs and glutes
- **Single-Leg Press**: Unilateral version for imbalances

## Common Mistakes

- Letting the lower back round off the pad
- Bouncing at the bottom of the movement
- Locking out knees completely
- Using too narrow a range of motion
