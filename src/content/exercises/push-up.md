The push-up is one of the most effective bodyweight exercises for building upper body strength and can be done anywhere without equipment.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Start in a high plank position with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, fingers pointing forward.

2. **Align**: Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core and glutes.

3. **Lower**: Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward the floor. Keep elbows at about a 45-degree angle from your body.

4. **Bottom**: Lower until your chest nearly touches the floor or your upper arms are parallel to the ground.

5. **Push**: Press through your palms to extend your arms and return to the starting position.

## Tips

- Keep your core tight throughout the movement
- Don't let your hips sag or pike up
- Look slightly ahead, not straight down
- Breathe in on the way down, out on the way up

## Variations

- **Knee Push-Ups**: Easier modification for beginners
- **Incline Push-Ups**: Hands elevated on bench (easier)
- **Decline Push-Ups**: Feet elevated (harder, targets upper chest)
- **Diamond Push-Ups**: Hands close together (targets triceps)
- **Wide Push-Ups**: Hands wider apart (emphasizes chest)

## Common Mistakes

- Flaring elbows out to 90 degrees (stresses shoulders)
- Incomplete range of motion
- Letting hips sag toward the floor
- Not engaging the core
