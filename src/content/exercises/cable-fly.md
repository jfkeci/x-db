The cable fly is an excellent chest isolation exercise that maintains constant tension on the pecs throughout the entire range of motion, making it superior to dumbbell flyes for muscle activation.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Set both pulleys to the highest position. Stand in the center of the cable station and grab a handle in each hand.

2. **Start Position**: Step forward into a staggered stance for stability. Extend your arms out to the sides with a slight bend in your elbows, palms facing forward.

3. **Squeeze**: Bring your hands together in front of your chest in a hugging motion, focusing on squeezing your pecs. Keep the slight bend in your elbows throughout.

4. **Return**: Slowly return to the starting position, feeling a stretch across your chest.

5. **Repeat**: Maintain control and repeat for desired reps.

## Tips

- Keep a slight bend in your elbows throughout
- Focus on squeezing your chest, not your arms
- Use a weight that allows for controlled movement
- Experiment with pulley height for different angles

## Variations

- **Low Cable Fly**: Pulleys at bottom, targets upper chest
- **Mid Cable Fly**: Pulleys at shoulder height, overall chest
- **High-to-Low Cable Fly**: Targets lower chest
- **Single-Arm Cable Fly**: Unilateral version for imbalances

## Common Mistakes

- Using too much weight and losing form
- Bending elbows too much (turns into a press)
- Not achieving full stretch at the start
- Rushing through the movement
