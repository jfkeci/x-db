The box jump is a plyometric exercise that develops explosive power in the lower body. It's a staple in athletic training programs and an effective way to build fast-twitch muscle fibers.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Stand facing a plyo box at an appropriate height, about arm's length away. Feet should be shoulder-width apart.

2. **Load**: Bend your knees and swing your arms back, loading your legs like a spring. Keep your chest up.

3. **Explode**: Swing your arms forward and up while explosively extending your hips, knees, and ankles to jump onto the box.

4. **Land**: Land softly on the box with both feet, absorbing the impact by bending your knees. Stand up fully at the top.

5. **Step Down**: Step back down one foot at a time (don't jump down) to protect your joints. Reset and repeat.

## Tips

- Start with a lower box and progress gradually
- Focus on soft, quiet landings
- Always step down rather than jump down
- Use your arms to generate momentum

## Variations

- **Seated Box Jump**: Start from seated position for pure power
- **Single-Leg Box Jump**: Advanced unilateral version
- **Depth Jump**: Step off box, land, immediately jump up
- **Burpee Box Jump**: Combine burpee with box jump

## Common Mistakes

- Starting with a box that's too high
- Landing with straight legs
- Jumping down instead of stepping down
- Not fully extending hips at takeoff
