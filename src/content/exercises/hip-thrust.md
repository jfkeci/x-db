The hip thrust is widely considered the best exercise for glute development, allowing for heavy loading in a position of peak glute contraction.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Sit on the ground with your upper back against a bench. Roll a barbell over your legs to rest on your hip crease.

2. **Position**: Plant your feet flat on the floor, about shoulder-width apart, with knees bent at 90 degrees at the top.

3. **Thrust**: Drive through your heels and squeeze your glutes to lift your hips until your body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees.

4. **Squeeze**: Hold the top position briefly, focusing on maximum glute contraction.

5. **Lower**: Slowly lower your hips back down with control.

## Tips

- Keep your chin tucked throughout the movement
- Drive through your heels, not your toes
- Don't hyperextend your lower back at the top
- Use a barbell pad for comfort

## Variations

- **Bodyweight Hip Thrust**: Start here before adding weight
- **Single-Leg Hip Thrust**: Advanced unilateral variation
- **Banded Hip Thrust**: Add a band around knees for extra glute activation
- **Foot-Elevated Hip Thrust**: Increased range of motion

## Common Mistakes

- Hyperextending the lower back at the top
- Pushing through toes instead of heels
- Not achieving full hip extension
- Rushing the movement without control
