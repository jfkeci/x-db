The shoulder press is a fundamental movement for building shoulder strength and size, with carryover to many athletic movements and daily activities.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Sit or stand with dumbbells at shoulder height, palms facing forward. Keep your core braced.

2. **Press**: Push the weights directly overhead, bringing them together at the top without clanging.

3. **Lockout**: Fully extend your arms at the top, with the weights directly over your shoulders.

4. **Lower**: Control the weights back down to shoulder height.

5. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions.

## Tips

- Keep your core tight to protect your lower back
- Don't arch your back excessively
- Press the weights in a slight arc, bringing them together at the top
- Control the negative portion of the lift

## Variations

- **Seated Dumbbell Press**: More stability, stricter form
- **Standing Barbell Press**: Heavier loading possible
- **Arnold Press**: Rotation adds front delt emphasis
- **Push Press**: Use leg drive for heavier weights
- **Single-Arm Press**: Challenges core stability

## Common Mistakes

- Excessive lower back arch
- Pressing the weights too far forward
- Using momentum to lift the weight
- Not achieving full lockout
