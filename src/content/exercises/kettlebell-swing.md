The kettlebell swing is a foundational kettlebell exercise that combines strength and cardio. It's incredibly efficient for building posterior chain power while torching calories.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, kettlebell on the floor about a foot in front of you.

2. **Hike**: Hinge at the hips, grab the kettlebell with both hands, and hike it back between your legs like a football snap.

3. **Drive**: Explosively drive your hips forward, squeezing your glutes. Let the hip power swing the kettlebell up.

4. **Float**: The kettlebell should float to about chest or eye level. Your arms are just along for the ride—they don't pull.

5. **Hinge Back**: As the kettlebell falls, hinge at the hips and guide it back between your legs to begin the next rep.

## Tips

- Power comes from your hips, not your arms
- Keep your back flat throughout
- Squeeze your glutes hard at the top
- Breathe out forcefully at the top of each swing

## Variations

- **Single-Arm Swing**: One arm at a time
- **American Swing**: Swing overhead (more controversial)
- **Alternating Swing**: Switch hands at the top
- **Double Kettlebell Swing**: Two kettlebells for added load

## Common Mistakes

- Squatting instead of hinging
- Using arms to lift the kettlebell
- Rounding the lower back
- Not fully extending the hips at the top
- Letting the kettlebell pull you forward
