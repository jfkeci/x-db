The face pull is one of the best exercises for shoulder health and posture. It targets the often-neglected rear deltoids and upper back muscles that counteract the effects of sitting and pressing movements.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Attach a rope to a cable machine at face height. Grip the rope with palms facing each other and step back to create tension.

2. **Start Position**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, arms extended in front of you. Lean back slightly for stability.

3. **Pull**: Pull the rope toward your face, separating the ends as you pull. Drive your elbows high and back.

4. **Squeeze**: At the end position, your hands should be beside your ears with elbows flared out. Squeeze your rear delts and upper back.

5. **Return**: Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position with control.

## Tips

- Keep your elbows high throughout the movement
- Focus on external rotation at the end of the pull
- Don't use excessive weight—this is about quality contraction
- Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the peak

## Variations

- **High Face Pull**: Pulley set higher, pull toward forehead
- **Low Face Pull**: Pulley set lower, emphasizes lower traps
- **Band Face Pull**: Using resistance bands instead of cable
- **Prone Face Pull**: Lying on incline bench for stricter form

## Common Mistakes

- Using too much weight
- Pulling to the chest instead of the face
- Not achieving external rotation
- Letting elbows drop during the movement
