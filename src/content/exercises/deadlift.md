The deadlift is a fundamental strength exercise that builds total body power and strength, particularly targeting the posterior chain.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Stand with feet hip-width apart, bar over mid-foot. Bend at hips and knees to grip the bar just outside your legs.

2. **Position**: Keep your chest up, back flat, and shoulders slightly in front of the bar.

3. **Lift**: Take a breath, brace your core, and drive through your feet while keeping the bar close to your body.

4. **Lockout**: Stand tall with hips and knees fully extended, shoulders back.

5. **Lower**: Push your hips back first, then bend your knees to return the bar to the floor.

## Tips

- Keep the bar close to your body throughout the lift
- Don't round your lower back
- Engage your lats to keep the bar path straight
- Think of pushing the floor away rather than pulling the bar up

## Variations

- **Sumo Deadlift**: Wider stance, hands inside legs
- **Romanian Deadlift**: Focuses on hamstrings with less knee bend
- **Trap Bar Deadlift**: Easier on the lower back
- **Deficit Deadlift**: Increased range of motion
