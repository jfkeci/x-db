The burpee is one of the most effective full-body exercises for building cardiovascular endurance, burning calories, and developing functional fitness.

## How to Perform

1. **Start**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, arms at your sides.

2. **Squat**: Bend your knees and lower into a squat, placing your hands on the floor in front of you.

3. **Jump Back**: Kick your feet back to land in a push-up position.

4. **Push-Up**: Perform a push-up (optional but recommended for full benefit).

5. **Jump Forward**: Jump your feet back toward your hands, returning to the squat position.

6. **Jump Up**: Explosively jump into the air, reaching your arms overhead.

7. **Repeat**: Land softly and immediately go into the next rep.

## Tips

- Land softly to protect your joints
- Keep your core engaged throughout
- Maintain a steady pace you can sustain
- Breathe rhythmically—exhale on the jump

## Variations

- **Half Burpee**: Skip the push-up for lower intensity
- **Step-Back Burpee**: Step feet back instead of jumping (easier)
- **Burpee Box Jump**: Jump onto a box instead of in place
- **Burpee Pull-Up**: Add a pull-up at the top
- **Single-Leg Burpee**: Advanced unilateral variation

## Common Mistakes

- Landing with locked knees
- Letting hips sag in the plank position
- Not fully extending on the jump
- Going too fast and sacrificing form
