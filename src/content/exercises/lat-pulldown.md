The lat pulldown is a fundamental back exercise that mimics the pull-up movement pattern, making it an excellent choice for beginners or as a supplementary exercise for building back width.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Sit at the lat pulldown machine and adjust the thigh pad to secure your legs. Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width with palms facing away.

2. **Start Position**: With arms fully extended overhead, lean back slightly (about 10-15 degrees) and puff your chest up.

3. **Pull**: Drive your elbows down and back, pulling the bar toward your upper chest. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the bottom.

4. **Lower**: Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position with control, feeling the stretch in your lats.

5. **Repeat**: Maintain tension throughout and repeat for desired reps.

## Tips

- Focus on pulling with your elbows, not your hands
- Avoid leaning too far back or using momentum
- Keep your chest up throughout the movement
- Don't let the weight stack touch between reps

## Variations

- **Close-Grip Pulldown**: Emphasizes lower lats and biceps
- **Reverse-Grip Pulldown**: Underhand grip for more bicep involvement
- **Single-Arm Pulldown**: Unilateral version for imbalance correction
- **Behind-Neck Pulldown**: Not recommended due to shoulder stress

## Common Mistakes

- Using too much body momentum
- Pulling the bar behind the neck
- Not achieving full range of motion
- Gripping too wide or too narrow
