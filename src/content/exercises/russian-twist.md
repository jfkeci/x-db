The Russian twist is an effective core exercise that emphasizes rotational strength, which is crucial for sports performance and everyday functional movement.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Sit on the floor with knees bent and feet flat (or elevated for more challenge). Lean back slightly to engage your core.

2. **Position**: Clasp your hands together in front of your chest, or hold a weight for added resistance.

3. **Rotate**: Twist your torso to one side, bringing your hands toward the floor beside your hip.

4. **Return**: Rotate through center to the opposite side.

5. **Repeat**: Continue alternating sides for the desired number of repetitions.

## Tips

- Keep your back straight, not rounded
- Move from your core, not just your arms
- Keep your feet grounded (or elevated for advanced)
- Control the movement—don't use momentum

## Variations

- **Feet Down**: Easier variation with feet on the floor
- **Feet Elevated**: Harder, requires more core engagement
- **Weighted Russian Twist**: Hold a dumbbell, medicine ball, or plate
- **Decline Russian Twist**: Performed on decline bench for added difficulty

## Common Mistakes

- Rounding the lower back
- Moving only the arms instead of rotating the torso
- Going too fast and losing control
- Holding your breath
