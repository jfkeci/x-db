The bench press is one of the most popular and effective exercises for building upper body strength and muscle mass.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Lie flat on a bench with your feet firmly on the ground. Grip the barbell slightly wider than shoulder-width.

2. **Unrack**: Lift the bar off the rack and hold it directly above your chest with arms fully extended.

3. **Lower**: Slowly lower the bar to your mid-chest, keeping your elbows at about a 45-degree angle from your body.

4. **Press**: Push the bar back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.

5. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions.

## Tips

- Keep your shoulder blades squeezed together throughout the movement
- Maintain a slight arch in your lower back
- Don't bounce the bar off your chest
- Use a spotter when lifting heavy weights

## Variations

- **Incline Bench Press**: Targets upper chest
- **Decline Bench Press**: Targets lower chest
- **Dumbbell Bench Press**: Allows greater range of motion
- **Close-Grip Bench Press**: Emphasizes triceps
