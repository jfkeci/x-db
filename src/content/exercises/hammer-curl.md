The hammer curl uses a neutral (palms facing each other) grip that shifts emphasis to the brachialis muscle and forearms, helping to build overall arm thickness and grip strength.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides with palms facing your body (neutral grip).

2. **Brace**: Keep your elbows close to your sides and your upper arms stationary throughout the movement.

3. **Curl**: Curl the weights up toward your shoulders while maintaining the neutral grip. Keep your wrists straight.

4. **Squeeze**: At the top, squeeze your biceps and brachialis briefly.

5. **Lower**: Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position with control.

## Tips

- Keep your elbows pinned to your sides
- Don't swing the weights or use momentum
- Maintain the neutral grip throughout
- Control the eccentric (lowering) phase

## Variations

- **Alternating Hammer Curl**: One arm at a time
- **Cross-Body Hammer Curl**: Curl across your body toward opposite shoulder
- **Incline Hammer Curl**: On incline bench for greater stretch
- **Rope Hammer Curl**: Using cable machine with rope attachment
- **Preacher Hammer Curl**: On preacher bench for isolation

## Common Mistakes

- Swinging the body for momentum
- Letting elbows drift forward
- Using too much weight
- Rotating the wrists during the movement
