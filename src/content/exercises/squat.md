The barbell squat is considered one of the most effective exercises for building lower body strength and overall muscle mass.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Position the bar on your upper back (high bar) or rear deltoids (low bar). Step back from the rack with feet shoulder-width apart.

2. **Brace**: Take a deep breath and brace your core. Keep your chest up and eyes forward.

3. **Descend**: Push your hips back and bend your knees, lowering until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground.

4. **Ascend**: Drive through your heels, pushing the floor away as you stand back up.

5. **Repeat**: Exhale at the top and repeat for desired reps.

## Tips

- Keep your knees tracking over your toes
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement
- Don't let your knees cave inward
- Go as deep as your mobility allows while maintaining form

## Common Mistakes

- Rounding the lower back
- Rising on toes
- Knees caving in
- Not hitting proper depth
- Looking up or down instead of forward
