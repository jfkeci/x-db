Tricep dips are one of the most effective bodyweight exercises for building tricep size and strength, while also engaging the chest and shoulders.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Grip parallel bars with arms fully extended, supporting your body weight. Keep your torso upright.

2. **Lower**: Bend your elbows to lower your body until your upper arms are parallel to the ground or slightly below.

3. **Bottom**: Keep your elbows pointing backward, not flaring out to the sides.

4. **Push**: Press through your palms to extend your arms and return to the starting position.

5. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions with control.

## Tips

- Keep your body upright to emphasize triceps (lean forward for more chest)
- Don't go too deep if you have shoulder issues
- Control the descent—don't drop down
- Lock out fully at the top

## Variations

- **Bench Dips**: Easier variation using a bench behind you
- **Assisted Dips**: Use a machine or band for support
- **Weighted Dips**: Add a belt with weight for progression
- **Ring Dips**: Unstable surface for advanced training

## Common Mistakes

- Going too deep and stressing the shoulders
- Flaring elbows out to the sides
- Using momentum or bouncing at the bottom
- Not achieving full lockout at the top
