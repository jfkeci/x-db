The hanging leg raise is one of the most challenging and effective exercises for developing the lower abdominals. It also builds grip strength and hip flexor endurance.

## How to Perform

1. **Setup**: Hang from a pull-up bar with an overhand grip, arms fully extended. Your body should be in a straight line.

2. **Brace**: Engage your core and avoid swinging. Keep your legs straight or with a slight bend.

3. **Raise**: Lift your legs by flexing at the hips, keeping them as straight as possible. Raise until your legs are parallel to the ground (or higher for more difficulty).

4. **Hold**: Pause briefly at the top, squeezing your abs.

5. **Lower**: Slowly lower your legs back to the starting position with control, resisting the urge to swing.

## Tips

- Avoid swinging or using momentum
- Keep your core engaged throughout
- Start with bent knees if straight legs are too difficult
- Focus on lifting with your abs, not hip flexors alone

## Variations

- **Knee Raise**: Easier version with bent knees
- **Toes-to-Bar**: Touch your toes to the bar for full range
- **Windshield Wipers**: Rotate legs side to side at the top
- **Captain's Chair Leg Raise**: Using dip station with back support

## Common Mistakes

- Swinging to generate momentum
- Using only hip flexors instead of engaging abs
- Not controlling the lowering phase
- Holding breath instead of breathing properly
