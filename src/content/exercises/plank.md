The plank is a fundamental core exercise that strengthens the entire midsection while also engaging the shoulders and glutes.

## How to Perform

1. **Position**: Start in a push-up position, then lower to your forearms. Elbows should be directly under shoulders.

2. **Align**: Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.

3. **Engage**: Squeeze your abs, glutes, and quads. Don't let your hips sag or pike up.

4. **Hold**: Maintain the position for the desired time while breathing normally.

## Tips

- Look at the floor to keep your neck neutral
- Don't hold your breath
- Squeeze your glutes to help maintain alignment
- Start with shorter holds and build up over time

## Variations

- **Side Plank**: Targets obliques
- **Plank with Shoulder Taps**: Adds anti-rotation challenge
- **Elevated Plank**: Easier modification with hands on bench
- **Weighted Plank**: Add a plate on your back for advanced training

## Common Mistakes

- Hips sagging toward the floor
- Hips piking up too high
- Holding breath
- Looking up (straining neck)
